Preview your docs locally before pushing changes. All you need is Docker and a `docs/` directory.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running
- Your content repo cloned locally with a `docs/` directory containing at least `index.mdx`

## Start the Dev Server

From the root of your content repo, run:

```sh
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd)/docs:/content/docs" \
  -p 4321:4321 \
  -e MODE=dev \
  ghcr.io/f5xc-salesdemos/docs-builder:latest
```

Open **http://localhost:4321** once the server starts.

:::note
File changes on your host require restarting the container. Stop it with `Ctrl+C` and re-run the command to pick up edits.
:::

## Images and Static Assets

Place images in a subdirectory like `docs/images/`. The container detects these automatically — no extra volume mounts needed.

Reference them in your MDX with a root-relative path:

```mdx
![Architecture diagram](/images/architecture.png)
```

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use** — Map to a different host port: `-p 8080:4321`, then open `http://localhost:8080`.

**Content not appearing** — Verify `docs/index.mdx` exists. Check the container output for an `ERROR: No content found` message.

**Stale image** — Pull the latest version:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/f5xc-salesdemos/docs-builder:latest
```
